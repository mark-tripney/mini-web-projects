# Expanding Cards

A gallery with five cards (switching to three on narrow viewports).

- When a card is clicked, it expands to show more of the image.
- Correspondingly, the already-expanded image contracts.
- An image's text appears as it expands; text is not shown in contracted mode.

## TODO

Consider accessibility issues with, for example, `opacity: 0`, and take action where necessary.
